# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Narwhals! Any kind of improvement is welcome!

## Local development vs Codespaces
You can contribute to Narwhals in your local development environment, using python3, git and your editor of choice.
You can also contribute to Narwhals using [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) - a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.
This way you can easily start to work from your browser without installing git and cloning the repo.
Scroll down for instructions on how to use [Codespaces](#working-with-codespaces).

## Working with local development environment

### 1. Make sure you have git on your machine and a GitHub account

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git --version
``` 

If the output looks like `git version 2.34.1` and you have a personal account on GitHub - you're good to go to the next step.
If the terminal output informs about `command not found` you need to [install git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

If you're new to GitHub, you'll need to create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and verify your email address.

You should also [check for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) and
[generate and add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
if you don't have one already.

### 2. Fork the repository

Go to the [main project page](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals).
Fork the repository by clicking on the fork button. You can find it in the right corner on the top of the page.

### 3. Clone the repository

Go to the forked repository on your GitHub account - you'll find it on your account in the tab Repositories. 
Click on the green `Code` button and then click the `Copy url to clipboard` icon.
Open a terminal, choose the directory where you would like to have Narwhals repository and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone <url you just copied>
``` 

for example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/narwhals.git narwhals-dev
```

You should then navigate to the folder you just created:

```bash
cd narwhals-dev
```


### 4. Add the `upstream` remote and fetch from it

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:narwhals-dev/narwhals.git
git fetch upstream
``` 

Check to see the remote has been added with `git remote -v`, you should see something like this:

```bash
git remote -v                                                          
origin	git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/narwhals.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/narwhals.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:narwhals-dev/narwhals.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:narwhals-dev/narwhals.git (push)
```

where `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` will be your GitHub user name.

### 5. Setting up your environment

Here's how you can set up your local development environment to contribute.

#### Prerequisites for PySpark tests

If you want to run PySpark-related tests, you'll need to have Java installed. Refer to the [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/#downloading) for more information.

#### Option 1: Use UV (recommended)

1. Make sure you have Python3.12 installed, create a virtual environment,
   and activate it. If you're new to this, here's one way that we recommend:
   1. Install uv: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started
      or make sure it is up-to-date with:
      ```
      uv self update
      ```
   2. Install Python3.12:
      ```
      uv python install 3.12
      ```
   3. Create a virtual environment:
      ```
      uv venv -p 3.12 --seed
      ```
   4. Activate it. On Linux, this is `. .venv/bin/activate`, on Windows `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`.
2. Install Narwhals: `uv pip install -e ".[dev, core, docs]"`. This will include fast-ish core libraries.
   If you also want to test other libraries like Dask , PySpark, and Modin, you can install them too with
   `uv pip install -e ".[dev, core, docs, dask, pyspark, modin]"`.
3. Install a fork of griffe:
   ```
   uv pip install git+https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/griffe.git@no-overloads
   ```
   This is hopefully temporary until https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings/issues/716
   is addressed.

You should also install pre-commit:
```
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
This will automatically format and lint your code before each commit, and it will block the commit if any issues are found.

#### Option 2: use python3-venv

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. If you don't, you can check [install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
   to learn how. Then, [create and activate](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
   a virtual environment.
2. Then, follow steps 2-4 from above but using `pip install` instead of `uv pip install`.

### 6. Working on your issue

Create a new git branch from the `main` branch in your local repository.
Note that your work cannot be merged if the test below fail.
If you add code that should be tested, please add tests.

### 7. Running tests

- To run tests, run `pytest`. To check coverage: `pytest --cov=narwhals`
- To run tests on the doctests, use `pytest narwhals --doctest-modules`
- To run unit tests and doctests at the same time, run `pytest tests narwhals --cov=narwhals --doctest-modules`
- To run tests multiprocessed, you may also want to use [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) (optional)
- To choose which backends to run tests with you, you can use the `--constructors` flag:
  - To only run tests for pandas, Polars, and PyArrow, use `pytest --constructors=pandas,pyarrow,polars`
  - To run tests for all CPU constructors, use `pytest --all-cpu-constructors`
  - By default, tests run for pandas, pandas (PyArrow dtypes), PyArrow, and Polars.
  - To run tests using `cudf.pandas`, run `NARWHALS_DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTORS=pandas python -m cudf.pandas -m pytest`
  - To run tests using `polars[gpu]`, run `NARWHALS_POLARS_GPU=1 pytest --constructors=polars[lazy]`

If you want to have less surprises when opening a PR, you can take advantage of [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/index.html) to run the entire CI/CD test suite locally in your operating system.

To do so, you will first need to install nox and then run the `nox` command in the root of the repository:

```bash
python -m pip install nox  # python -m pip install "nox[uv]"
nox
```

Notice that nox will also require to have all the python versions that are defined in the `noxfile.py` installed in your system.

#### Hypothesis tests

We use Hypothesis to generate some random tests, to check for robustness.
To keep local test suite times down, not all of these run by default - you can
run them by passing the `--runslow` flag to PyTest.

#### Testing Dask and Modin

To keep local development test times down, Dask and Modin are excluded from dev
dependencies, and their tests only run in CI. If you install them with

```
uv pip install -U dask[dataframe] modin
```
then their tests will run too.

#### Testing cuDF

We can't currently test in CI against cuDF, but you can test it manually in Kaggle using GPUs. Please follow this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marcogorelli/testing-cudf-in-narwhals) to run the tests.

### 8. Building docs

To build the docs, run `mkdocs serve`, and then open the link provided in a browser.
The docs should refresh when you make changes. If they don't, press `ctrl+C`, and then
do `mkdocs build` and then `mkdocs serve`.

### 9. Pull requests

When you have resolved your issue, [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) in the Narwhals repository.

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Start your pull request title with a [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) tag. This helps us add your contribution to the right section of the changelog. We use "Type" from the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).<br>
    TLDR:
    The PR title should start with any of these abbreviations: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `depr`,
    `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `release`, `test`. Add a `!`at the end, if it is a breaking change. For example `refactor!`.
    <br>
2. This text will end up in the [changelog](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals/releases).
3. Please follow the instructions in the pull request form and submit. 

## Working with Codespaces
Codespaces is a great way to work on Narwhals without the need of configuring your local development environment.
Every GitHub.com user has a monthly quota of free use of GitHub Codespaces, and you can start working in a codespace without providing any payment details.
You'll be informed per email if you'll be close to using 100% of included services.
To learn more about it visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)


### 1. Make sure you have GitHub account

If you're new to GitHub, you'll need to create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and verify your email address.

### 2. Fork the repository

Go to the [main project page](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals).
Fork the repository by clicking on the fork button. You can find it in the right corner on the top of the page.

### 3. Create codespace 

Go to the forked repository on your GitHub account - you'll find it on your account in the tab Repositories. 
Click on the green `Code` button and navigate to the `Codespaces` tab.
Click on the green button `Create codespace on main` - it will open a browser version of VSCode,
with the complete repository and git installed. 
You can now proceed with the steps [4. Setting up your environment](#4-setting-up-your-environment) up to [8. Pull request](#8-pull-requests)
listed above in [Working with local development environment](#working-with-local-development-environment).


## How it works

If Narwhals looks like underwater unicorn magic to you, then please read
[how it works](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/how_it_works/).

## Imports

In Narwhals, we are very particular about imports. When it comes to importing
heavy third-party libraries (pandas, NumPy, Polars, etc...) please follow these rules:

- Never import anything to do `isinstance` checks. Instead, just use the functions
  in `narwhals.dependencies` (such as `is_pandas_dataframe`);
- If you need to import anything, do it in a place where you know that the import
  is definitely available. For example, NumPy is a required dependency of PyArrow,
  so it's OK to import NumPy to implement a PyArrow function - however, NumPy
  should never be imported to implement a Polars function. The only exception is
  for when there's simply no way around it by definition - for example, `Series.to_numpy`
  always requires NumPy to be installed.
- Don't place a third-party import at the top of a file. Instead, place it in the
  function where it's used, so that we minimise the chances of it being imported
  unnecessarily.

We're trying to be really lightweight and minimal-overhead, and
unnecessary imports can slow things down.
