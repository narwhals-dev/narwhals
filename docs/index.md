Extremely lightweight compatibility layer between Polars, pandas, and more.

Seamlessly support both, without depending on either!

- ✅ **Just use** a subset of **the Polars API**, no need to learn anything new
- ✅ **No dependencies** (not even Polars), keep your library lightweight
- ✅ Support both **lazy** and eager execution
- ✅ Use Polars **Expressions**
- ✅ Tested against pandas and Polars nightly builds!

## Who's this for?

Anyone wishing to write a library/application/service which consumes dataframes, and wishing to make it
completely dataframe-agnostic.

Let's get started!
