# Avoiding the `UserWarning` error while using Pandas `group_by`

## Introduction

If you have ever experienced the

> UserWarning: Found complex group-by expression, which can't be expressed efficiently with the pandas API. If you can, please rewrite your query such that group-by aggregations are simple (e.g. mean, std, min, max, ...)

message while using the narwhals `group_by()` method, this is for you.
If you haven't, this is also for you as you might experience it and you need to know how to avoid it.

Take the following two codes as an example.

=== "Approach 1"
    ```python exec="true" source="above" result="python" session="df_ex1" hl_lines="12"
    import narwhals as nw
    import pandas as pd
    from narwhals.typing import IntoFrameT

    data = {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "b": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], "c": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}

    df_pd = pd.DataFrame(data)


    def approach_1(df_native: IntoFrameT) -> IntoFrameT:
        df = nw.from_native(df_native)
        df = df.group_by("a").agg(d=(nw.col("b") + nw.col("c")).sum())
        return df.to_native()


    print(approach_1(df_pd))
    ```

=== "Approach 2"
    ```python exec="true" source="above" result="python" session="df_ex2" hl_lines="11"
    import narwhals as nw
    import pandas as pd

    data = {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "b": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], "c": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}

    df_pd = pd.DataFrame(data)


    def approach_2(df_native: IntoFrameT) -> IntoFrameT:
        df = nw.from_native(df_native)
        df = df.with_columns(d=nw.col("b") + nw.col("c")).group_by("a").agg(nw.sum("d"))
        return df.to_native()


    print(approach_2(df_pd))
    ```

Both approaches shown above return the exact same result, but Approach 1 is inefficient and returns the warning message
we showed at the top.

What makes the first approach inefficient and the second approach efficient? It comes down to what the
pandas API lets us express.

## Approach 1

The literal pandas translation is:

```python
df.groupby("a").apply(
    lambda df: pd.Series([(df["b"] + df["c"]).sum()], index=["d"]), include_groups=False
)
```

pandas experts immediately recognise the issue: it uses `apply`.
Any time you use `apply` in pandas, that's a performance footgun - best to avoid it and use vectorised operations instead.
Let's take a look at how "approach 2" gets translated to pandas to see the difference.

## Approach 2

The literal pandas translation is:

```python
df.assign(d=lambda df: df["b"] + df["c"]).groupby("a").agg({"d": "sum"})
```

Because we're using pandas' own API, as opposed to `apply` and a custom `lambda` function,
then this is going to be much more efficient! That's why it's preferred.

## Tips for Avoiding the `UserWarning`

1. Decompose complex operations: break down complex transformations into simpler steps.
   In this case, keep the `.agg` method simple.
   Compute new columns first, then use these columns in aggregation or other operations.
2. Avoid redundant computations: if an operation (like addition) is used multiple times,
   compute it once and store the result in a new column.
