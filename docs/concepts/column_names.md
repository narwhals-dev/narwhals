# Column names

Polars and PyArrow only allow for string column names. What about pandas?

```python exec="true" source="above" result="python" session="col_names"
import pandas as pd

df = pd.concat([pd.Series([1, 2], name=0), pd.Series([1, 3], name=0)], axis=1)
print(df)
```

Oh...not only does it let us create a dataframe with a column named `0` - it lets us
create one with _two_ such columns!

What does Narwhals do about this?

- In general, non-string column names are supported. In some places where this might
  create ambiguity (such as `DataFrame.__getitem__` or `DataFrame.select`) we may be strict and only
  allow passing in column names if they're strings.
- If you have a use-case that's
  failing for non-string column names, please report it to [https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals/issues](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals/issues)
  and we'll see if we can support it.
- Duplicate column names are ðŸš« banned ðŸš«.
